Invisible Cloak Project

Overview

The Invisible Cloak project is a fun and creative application of computer vision techniques using Python and OpenCV. The project allows users to simulate an "invisibility cloak" effect, inspired by science fiction and fantasy (like the Harry Potter series). When a specific colored cloth (the "cloak") is used, it renders the user invisible by replacing the cloak's color with the background.
